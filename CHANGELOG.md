# 0.5.0 (2020-07-26)

## Features

* Moved events from callbacks to channels (currently using std::channel, will
  change to future::Stream once we go async).
* Moved from using Arc<Mutex<HashMap<K,V>>> to Arc<DashMap<K,V>>. Slightly
  cleaner, less locking boilerplate.

## Bugfixes

* Centralized peripheral management into the AdapterManager class, which should
  clean up a bunch of bugs both filed and not.

  Win10/MacOS/Linux/Maybe iOS.
