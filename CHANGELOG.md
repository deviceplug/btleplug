  platforms.

## Bugfixes

- Linux implementation will now synthesise `DeviceConnected` events at the start of the event stream
  for all peripherals which were already connected at the point that the event stream was requested.
- `Central` methods on Linux will now correctly only affect the correct Bluetooth adapter, rather
  than all adapters on the system.

# 0.9.0 (2021-10-20)

## Features

- Added Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) peripheral property.
- Peripheral `notifications()` streams can now be queried before any
  connection and remain valid independent of any re-connections.
- Characteristics are now grouped by service, and infomation about services is available. The old
  API to access characteristics without specifying a service UUIDs is retained for backwards
  compatibility.
- Better logging and other minor improvements in examples.
- Added method to get adapter information. For now it only works on Linux.

## Breaking changes

- Removed `CentralEvent::DeviceLost`. It wasn't emitted anywhere.
- Changed tx_power_level type from i8 to i16.
- Removed `PeripheralProperties::discovery_count`.
- New `PeripheralId` type is used as an opaque ID for peripherals, as the MAC address is not
  available on all platforms.
- Added optional `ScanFilter` parameter to `Central::start_scan` to filter by service UUIDs.

## Bugfixes

- `Peripheral::is_connected` now works on Mac OS, and works better on Windows.
- Fixed bug on Windows where RSSI was reported as TX power.
- Report address type on Windows.
- Report all advertised service UUIDs on Windows, rather than only those in the most recent
  advertisement.
- Fixed bug with service caching on Windows.
- Fixed bug with concurrent streams not working on Linux.

## Bugfixes

# 0.5.1 (2020-08-03)

## Bugfixes

* Fixed issue with peripheral updates in adapter manager wiping out peripherals
  completely (#64)
* Ran rustfmt (misformatted code is a bug ok?)

# 0.5.0 (2020-07-26)

## Features

* Moved events from callbacks to channels (currently using std::channel, will
  change to future::Stream once we go async).
* Moved from using Arc<Mutex<HashMap<K,V>>> to Arc<DashMap<K,V>>. Slightly
  cleaner, less locking boilerplate.

## Bugfixes

* Centralized peripheral management into the AdapterManager class, which should
  clean up a bunch of bugs both filed and not.

# 0.4.4 (2020-07-22)

## Bugfixes

* Fix peripheral connect panic caused by uuid length on macOS (#43)
* Windows/macOS devices now emit events on device disconnect (#54)

# 0.4.3 (2020-06-05)

* Allow notification handlers to be FnMut
* Added new examples
* Update dependencies

## Bugfixes

* Fix local_name on macOS 10.15

# 0.4.2 (2020-04-18)

## Features

* Some types now capable of serde de/serialization, using "serde" feature
* Added new examples

## Bugfixes

* Adapters functions now return vectors of some kind of adapter on all
  platforms.
* Bluez notification handlers now live with the peripheral.
* Bluez defaults to active scan.
* Remove all println statements in library (mostly in the windows library),
  replace with log macros.

# 0.4.1 (2020-03-16)

## Features

* Get BDAddr and UUID from String
* More examples
* Update dependencies

# 0.4.0 (2020-01-20)

## Features

* Added CoreBluetooth Support, using async-std with most of the async
  parts wrapped in block_on calls for now. Library now supports
  Win10/MacOS/Linux/Maybe iOS.
* Brought code up to Rust 2018 standard
* Added Characteristic UUID to ValueNotification struct, since
  only linux deals with Start/End/Value handles

# 0.3.1 (2020-01-11)

## Features

* Initial fork from rumble
* Brought in winrt patch, as well as other PRs on that project.
